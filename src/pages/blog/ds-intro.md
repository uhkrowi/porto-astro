Data structure is a systematic way to store and organize data in order to use it efficiently in time (how long the time it takes) and/or space (memory allocation), in other words it a way how you manage data with usage of memory as small as possible and with execution time as little as possible.

Data structure is agnostic or independent from programming languages, so you can implement the idea in any language you want, itâ€™s also provides operations to organize the data easily. Some data structures you have probably heard are array, linked list, stack, queue and graph.

Data structure can be used to implement another data structures, e.g you can use array or linked list to implement stack or queue.

When you want to implement the concept of a data structure, you need to know how the algorithm of the data structure works.

In case you want to implement data structure stack, you have to find out what are its behaviors. In a nutshell, stack is a data structure that performs LIFO (Last In First Out), it adds and removes items on the same place called TOP, think of pile of books, you add to the top of the pile and you take a book from the top of the pile.

In stack the operation of adding is called push, and the operation of deletion is called pop.
